Description: The SNP Panel Identification Assay (SPIA) is a package that enables an accurate determination of cell line identity from the genotype of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The SPIA test allows to discern when two cell lines are close enough to be called similar and when they are not. Details about the method are available at "Demichelis et al. (2008) SNP panel identification assay (SPIA): a genetic-based assay for the identification of cell lines. Nucleic Acids Res., 3, 2446-2456".
